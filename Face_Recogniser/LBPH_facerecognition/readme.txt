To run the code:

1] Run "create_data.py" while keeping your face in front of the webcam to create a folder "new" inside "datasets" containing 100 images of your face.

2] Rename the "new" folder as new datasets created will clear the folder and fill it with new images.

3] Now run "face_recognize.py" to to start the webcam to recognise faces.
